Intrusion Detection System                                                                                                                                   Octoberâ€™22 

---> Deployed a smart contract in blockchain for detecting the intensity of intrusion attacks in Remix using Solidity. 

---> Classified attacks as weak, intermediate or strong according to the log value of attack taken as input feature from packets. 

---> Authorized transactions and connected them to blockchain using DApps with intrusion detection smart contract as backend.
